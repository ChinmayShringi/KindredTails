      <h2>What our project provided</h2>
      <p>
        We are addressing a wide range of problems being faced by the society
        due to lack of awareness and sense of responsibility. In the 21st
        century, with the rise in statistical data for working parents, the most
        common option opted by them are daycare centers. When parents drop their
        children off at daycare, they expect that their kids will be safe. This
        is only possible with the proper security measures in place, such as
        security cameras, access control and visitor protocol. Security breaches
        can accidentally allow unauthorized people inside the facility, putting
        children at risk of kidnapping or injury. A few of them are listed below
        and our product helps in reducing them.
      </p>

      <h3>Child Abuse and bullying:</h3>
      <p>
        According to the data provided by the government, everyday 109 children
        are abused on daily basis (REPORTED CASES). Our product helps in
        identifying the voice patterns and send signal to parent if any hate
        speech, negative or suspicious comments are made by the speaker.
      </p>

      <h3>Human Trafficking and Kidnapping:</h3>
      <p>
        The count of people victim to human trafficking yearly is 6k (5264 in
        2018) and are the cases that are reported by their kin. Our product uses
        geolocation to gain access to the userâ€™s location and if the location is
        detected outside of safe area provided by their parents, an alert is
        sent to the customer showing the current location and thereby seeking
        officials help.
      </p>

      <h3>Allergies:</h3>
      <p>
        Children are allergic to certain food and may be exposed to them by
        carelessness of the daycare officials. Our product is integrated with
        OVA2640 camera equipped with image recognition to identify if the food
        kept in front of them is healthy for them or not, as listed by their
        parents.
      </p>
      <h3>Temperature and Pollution:</h3>
      <p>
        With the rise in us of air conditioners and air pollution children are
        subjected to cold temperatures and bad air. Our product will be equipped
        with IR sensors for temperature measurement and MQ135 to keep the
        quality of air in check.
